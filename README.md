# PHP Katas Roman Numerals converter

### **Problem:** *we need to build a class that will automatically translate a number into its roman numeral counterpart. We'll use TDD and PHPSpec to drive this process.*

>To run it, you should have **PHP** and **NodeJS** installed.<br>
(I expect you understand why, if not, I can teach you).

PS, we cover only up to 3999 as above there are symbols to cover larger numbers
(they repeat same pattern with a dash above them, so 5000 is V with dash above, like á¹¼)
