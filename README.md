# PHP Katas Roman Numerals converter

### **Problem:** *we need to build a class that will automatically translate a number into its roman numeral counterpart. We'll use TDD and PHPSpec to drive this process.*

>To run it, you should have **PHP** and **NodeJS** installed.<br>
(I expect you understand why, if not, I can teach you).

Credits to [Jeffrey](https://laracasts.com/series/code-katas-in-php/episodes/2)
for the video and his algorithm. This repo is not using his.

I made another algorithm that seemed more plausible for me.

PS, Covering up to 1,999,999 using special chars close to the real Roman concept
(the letters with a dash above).
